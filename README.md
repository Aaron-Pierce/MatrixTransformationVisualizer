# Matrix Transformation Visualizer

Visualizes a matrix transformation on a grid of dots.

I just found this in my projects directory. It would be nice if you could give it an arbitrary transformation, but right now it just computes {{2, 2}, {1, 1}}, a singular matrix, which is why the animation ends in a line.
